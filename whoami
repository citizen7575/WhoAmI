What I believe in and How I lead teams in Cybersecurity:



We strive align with DevSecOps philosophy - Automation and solutions through code that are repeatable and scalable

Work Effort Framework - We follow Scrum methodology for our project work: Milestones, Epics, Stories, Sprints, and all associated ceremonies

Transparency - If you request access you will get itâ€¦..at least read only. The more eyes on something, the better

Everyone has a Voice - Everyone on the team should feel empowered to speak up and reset our rudder. There are no stupid questions, arguments or 

Democratic decisions when possible - We strive for consensus. When possible we make decisions together. 

Shared Engineering effort - Other teams should have the freedom to contribute to our shared engineering efforts as their bandwidth allows.
